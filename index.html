     <p class="intro-text">Discovering what I wanted to pursue for my future career seemed liked an unanswerable question. Throughout high school, I enrolled in various classes and in different subject areas, but nothing seemed to interest me. I always enjoyed my English classes but was never truly excited about them. My passion for writing began to drain. However, journalism was the pivot.
       <br>
       <br>
       Having the ability to express myself creatively through my work is truly refreshing. My discovery of journalism allows me to become truly invested in my work. The many unique methods of storytelling excites me and ignites my passion for innovation. The field of journalism is my vocation.</p>

     <h3 class="head1">Career Objective</h3>
     <p class="intro-text">I strive to foster introspective thought and discussion through my work, valuing the many perspectives available. My love for writing and passion for journalism propel me to seek unique methods of storytelling that promote active engagement with audiences, while also being empathetic and reverent to the public I serve.</p>
